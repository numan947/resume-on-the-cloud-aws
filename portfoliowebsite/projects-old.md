## Past Research Projects

1. **Data Mining for Revealing Influential Socioeconomic Factors of Disease Outbreaks**  
   ***Description:***  
   Disease outbreaks occur all over the world almost every year. In this project, we tried to related the natures of disease outbreaks with different socioeconomic factors of different parts of the world. Specifically, we first accumulated data on disease outbreaks's occurrences (what, when and where), associated socioeconomic factors of that place and time, and the disease's natures. Then we used correlation techniques (Pearson and Spearman) to determine the potential influence of socioeconomic factors on the outbreaks of the diseases with the corresponding natures. We preprocessed and derived correlations of 193 socioeconomic attributes with 185 different characteristics of diseases (and their outbreaks).  
   This project can help choose better features for future Machine Learning models for disease outbreak detection and prediction. Additionally, it may direct further research to investigate the reasons behind the overt correlations between the variables.

## Personal Projects

1. **Re:SSD -  A Replication of Single Shot MultiBox Detector in PyTorch**  
   ***Type: Deep Learning / Computer Vision***  
   **Description:**  
   This is a project that I have done to enrich my knowledge of PyTorch, computer vision and deep learning in general. I replicated the experiments done in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02325" target="_blank">SSD paper</a> in which I achieved similar average precision and mean average precisions mentioned in the paper.

2. **Smile Detection**  
   ***Type: Deep Learning / Machine Learning***    
   **Description:**   
   Implemented simple CNN network to detect smile. Trained the classifier in colab using data found in <a href="https://github.com/hromi/SMILEsmileD" target="_blank">github</a>. Then created a simple program to classify and mark smiles in videos using *haar cascade classifier* and the trained model. The model achieved 93% test accuracy.  
   It was done as a part of learning **PyTorch** framework and the whole network is implemented in **PyTorch**.

3. **Bangla Handwritten Digit Recognition**    
   ***Type: Deep Learning / Machine Learning***    
   **Description:**    
   Implemented a Bangla Handwritten Digit recognizer using **PyTorch**. It achieved 89% accuracy on about 1000 test images collected using *Image Data Collection system*. We trained the model on data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/BengaliAI/numta" target="_blank">NumtaDB</a> . It was done as a part of testing Image Data Collection system and to facilitate learning of **PyTorch** framework.

4. **Image Data Collector System**  
   ***Type: Software / Research Tool***  
   **Description:**  
   Implemented a system for collecting and providing simple annotation for Image Data. It has an *Android* front end built using **IONIC** framework, while the back end uses **Flask**. It was tested in real server and we collected about 1000 hand written digit images. This system can also be modified to provide an online classification service by hosting a trained classifier in the server side.  
   I wanted to try out a **Cross Platform** framework and learn **Flask** as it's known to be very minimalistic. So, I built the system while teaching myself about these technologies. I am currently working with an extension of this idea which can be found <a target="_blank" href="/research">here</a>.

5. **FileShare**  
   ***Type: Software***  
   **Description:**  
   A two part system for file sharing between *Windows, Android and Linux* systems using a common Wifi network. PC's software is done using **JavaFX** while mobile's software is done using **Android SDK**. It was done to acquire a firm grasp on the concepts of **Multi-Threading and Socket Programming**.

6. **BrackFire**  
   ***Type: Software***  
   **Decription:**  
   A fire watch system that can be used to call nearby fire station, alert nearby devices (wit the app) and track the fire service car as it responds to a call.  
   Implemented the back end database using **Firebase API**, the **Tracking System** by using **Google Maps and Firebase API** simultaneously, and the **Push Notification System** using **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** API.  
   It was built as part of a freelance software development, and to get myself introduced to the aforementioned technologies.

<!-- 5. **Convolutor**  
   ***Type: Software / Research Tool***  
   **Description:**  
   A research tool that can calculate the output sizes of *2D Convolution, 2D Transposed Convolution, Max Pool 2D and Max Unpool 2D* given the required parameters. It is built using **Tkinter** framwork.  
   While learning **PyTorch**, I felt irritated as I had to calculate the outputs of different CNN and MaxPool layers again and again. So to ease the learning process as well as to learn a python GUI library, I implemented this simple calculator-like program in **Tkinter**.
