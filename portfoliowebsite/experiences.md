## Internship  

1. **R & D Intern**, April, 2018 -- July, 2018  
   REVE Systems, Bangladesh.  
   **Project:**  
   Worked on development of a Bangla Text To Speech (TTS) system using existing TTS systems.
   Specifically, our group worked on development of a system for accumulating phonemes for 
   Bangla words. We also experimented with different types of Vocoder to generate speech.
